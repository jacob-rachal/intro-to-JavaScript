console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("My name is Jacob Rachal, and I am a recently-graduated college student with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.")
console.log("Unfortunately, I've been having trouble finding a job.");
console.log("But while I am job-hunting, I thought I'd take these Geekwise classes and learn all the stuff that my college professors thought I didn't need to know. (Or didn't have time to teach.)");
console.log("It is my hope that I will be able to get out of this class a solid understanding of how to make use of JavaScript in my future projects, while also gaining experience experimenting with it.");
console.log("As for my hobbies; I really like to read books and online stories that of the genres sci-fi and fantasy, I enjoy seeing what I can construct with LEGOs, and watching videos that make me pleased to be a part of the human race");
